    Exception handling:
    Java
    Defition: An exception is an event, which occurs during the execution of a program, that disrupts,stops the normal
    flow of the program's instructions

    Compile Time:
            Compile Errors -> normally due to programmer's mistake regarding syntax, data types etc.

    During Runtime:
           ->Error -> happens due to environment issues. We do not handle them.
           ->Checked Exceptions -> are exceptions that programmer MUST handle otherwise code will fail to compile
           -> UnChecked Exceptions -> are exceptions that happen during runtime due to programmers mistake, and it is
           optional to handle them. Most of the time, programmer should do his best to fix his code and
           avoid UnCheckedExceptions
